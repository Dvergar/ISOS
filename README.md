Entity Component System architecture with networking support (for haxe).

Iteration from [ECS-Networking-Haxe](https://github.com/Dvergar/ECS-Networking-Haxe) with:

 * less code
 * less macros
 * automatic & fine-grained serialization of components
 * more constraints on the system use
 * FUTURE: YAML component definition
